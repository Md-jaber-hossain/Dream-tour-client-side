* This site is created with the help of react routing, firebase authentication, Node.js, Express.js, Mongodb back-end database.
* In this site, I have used Mongodb to store my data and login system with email and password and google authentication with firebase. For back-end Mongodb database, I have appilied CRUD operation to delete data, store data, update data and get the data.
* In home page, I have included Navbar, banner, packages of our tourist site, world coverd area by us and a footer. 
* If anyone wants to buy our packages, they can easily buy or booking by clicking the booking button and by following some steps. When anyone click the booking button then he or she should be logged in first. After successfully completion of login, they will be redirected to booking form and placing order. Then they will see their booking status in their booking page. If they want, they can cancel the booking by clicking cancel button.
